					<h3> Weather Updates  </h3>
					<p> March 5, 2016</p> <br>	
					<p>TIt is either pleasantly, shockingly, or worryingly warm today, as temperatures break 70 degrees and the sounds of birds chirping, people and dogs out and about, and children playing fill the streets. After a spotty, inconsistent, and not entirely terrible winter, we have a 15-day forecast above freezing, though, naturally, that comes with some thunderstorms.</p>

					<h3> How Chicago feels about Donald Trump </h3>
					<p> March 5, 2016</p> <br>
					<p>For all the talk of the Republican establishment trying to stop Donald Trump, it's the media establishment that is cranking up the volume to deafening levels. What’s remarkable about this sustained assault is that it comes with equal force from the right and the left, united in their passion to stop the man who is winning the most Republican primary votes. Presidential campaigns are rough, and opinion journalists often pound away at the candidates they dislike. These politicians get attacked on their record, background, temperament and for just about anything untoward they’ve done since grade school. But I’ve never seen anything like this.</p>
